# Phase 2 — Exams + Stronger Verification and QA
**Objective:** expand to exams and raise trust via deeper verification and scoring.

## Adds

- Form A/B
- SVA: contradiction detection, overreach detection, citation drift
- QAA: expanded scorecard (coverage, clarity, difficulty alignment)
- Remediation UX: “fix from issue” workflows

## Exit Criteria
- Exams pass verification and meet validity constraints.
- QA reports provide actionable remediation ranked by severity.
